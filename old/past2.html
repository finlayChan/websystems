            <p>I have spent most of my life in Australia, where my enthusiasm for sports <br> blossomed. From Tennis and Football to Nippers, Swimming, AFL, and <br> Basketball, I explored various athletic pursuits, with Basketball ultimately <br> becoming my greatest passion. My dedication led me to join multiple <br> representative teams and compete in prestigious events like the state cup, <br> where I achieved third place.</p>
            <p>Reflecting on my high school studies, I kept my options open, unsure of my future academic path. However, my interest in artificial intelligence has always captivated me, evidenced by my anticipation for opportunities like ChatGPT and DALL-E. </p>
            <p>In my Visual Arts major work, I aimed to blend the past and future using DALL-E and photography, delving into the intricate connection between the two realms. This exploration represents my fascination with the intersection of technology and creativity.</p>
            <p>I have no past experience in computing. However, I am currently in a programming fundamentals course that is teaching me the fundamentals of Java. However, I had some past knowledge of computing as my family has a history of programming and IT</p>
