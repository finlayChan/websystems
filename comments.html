              <h3>Personal Reflection</h3>
              <p>Throughout the planning process of my website, its design underwent several iterations. Ultimately, I opted for a simplistic style aimed at enhancing user experience by creating an easy navigation system with enjoyable readability. Initially, I envisioned a colour scheme of blue and white; however, I later pivoted towards a predominant theme with various shades of orange, complemented by a captivating sunset background. </p>
              <p>Given that this was my first-time coding, I encountered challenges with CSS and HTML, finding them both intricate and time-consuming. Nevertheless, I am pleased with the outcomeâ€”a website that aligns with my original vision and offers a seamless user experience. </p>
              <h3>Technical aspects</h3>
              <p>The website is structured as follows: it comprises multiple div containers, with the main ones across all four pages including the main container, navbar, as well as multiple div containers such as the logo. Each of these elements possesses distinct style properties and serves a unique purpose. </p>
              <p>The "main" container encompasses everything within it, with a fixed width and controlling the background sunset image. Its viewport height is fixed at 100, spanning the entire page. The font family is set to 'sans-serif', governing the font of all content within the "main" div container. </p>
              <p>The "navbar" container hosts the main navigation bar directing users to past, future, and comments pages. Utilizing an unordered list for navigation between pages, it employs five different CSS styles: menu class, ul, ul li, ul li a, and ul li a:hover. These styles dictate the position of the nav bar at the top right-hand side, along with colour, font, size, and hover effects. Padding and margins are set to ensure no overlap with other elements, while alignment is centred using 'align-items: centre' to adapt to varying viewport sizes. </p>
              <p>The "logo" div container displays the "WebSystems" logo in the top right corner of the page, adhering to the orange colour scheme with increased padding and font size for easy recognition. </p>
              <p>The navbar system employs hyperlinks styled to change colour upon hover using the 'a:hover' selector, with custom font sizes set using 'font-size'. Padding is applied to each menu and button item, with the default colour set to the main text colour (#fff or white). </p>
              <p>Dividing the website into separate "parts" or div containers facilitates easier CSS editing, enabling swift troubleshooting by isolating problematic selectors if issues arise during the coding process. </p>
              <h3>Aesthetics</h3>
              <p>The websites aesthetics are designed to be appealing, yet clear and easy to navigate and read. Here are some points outlining some of the aesthetical features of the website </p>
              <p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The website's colour palette draws inspiration from the colours of a sunset, predominantly featuring various shades of orange. This blend of the background and colour pallate provides a visually captivating webpage. </li>
                  <li>The main text, in #fff, stands out distinctly, especially against the deeper tones of orange thoughtfully chosen for contrast. Consistency in these colour schemes is maintained across all pages of the website. </li>
                  <li> The sans-serif font is the primary font used, enhancing readability and visual appeal for users navigating through the content. </li>
                  <li>The page title commands attention as the largest element, guiding users' focus to the information.  </li>
                  <li>  Interactive elements, such as navbar items, dynamically respond to user actions, with colour changes signalling engagement. Leveraging the orange colour scheme, buttons transition to shades of orange upon hovering, instantly catching the user's eye. To ensure a seamless experience, a gentle 0.3-second transition eases the colour change, alleviating any sense of urgency or stress for the user. </li>
                  <li>To enrich the visual depth of the page, a subtle 'linear-gradient' fade effect, transitioning from transparent at the bottom to semi-transparent black at the centre, enhances the horizon's depth to the page's centre, elevating its visual appeal. </li>
                  <li> Strategic padding within div containers, between images, text, and tables, minimizes clutter, ensuring a clean and organized appearance for the website. </li>
                  <li>In the comments section, subtle adjustments, such as left-aligned subheadings with increased font size and distinct typeface, facilitate easy comprehension and navigation, delineating between topics or questions effectively. </li>
                  <li>Moreover, ample white space, both horizontally and vertically, contributes to the website's overall polish and cleanliness, enhancing its presentation. </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <h3>Accessibility</h3> 
              <p>
                <ul>
                  <li>All images (excluding background images) are accompanied by descriptive 'alt' attributes, providing individuals with visual impairments a comprehensive understanding of the image content. </li>
                  <li>The main body text prominently contrasts with the background colour, facilitating effortless reading of the information presented on the page. </li>
                  <li>Both the page title and menu items are prominently displayed with increased size and clarity, aiding users in easily navigating the website and maintaining awareness of their location within the site. </li>
                  <li>I have attempted to make the website relative according to the size the user has the page, helping users on iPhone have similar experiences to those on desktop screens. </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
